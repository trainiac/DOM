# DOM

Simple DOM traversal and access methods

# TODO

- Finish writing tests
- Document API - try to do with documenting functions
- Add karma tests to get an idea for cross browser compatibility
- add webpack for AMD, UMD, CommonJS, import/export, and plain script builds
- Add badges (e.g. current npm package, is up to date, code coverage)
- Only use lodash functional functions that are needed
- Look to optimize webpack build with UglifyJs, etc.
- Create utilities library that removes utils.js
